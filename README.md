# Brazil-Memory-Game

## Elevator pitch

The game starts with 10 "squares" that shows the same picture, once you click on one of the squares a picture of one of my favorites spots in Brazil will show. There will be 5 different beautiful spots total. Once you see the picture you will click on a second picture, the goal is to find the pair of the first picture you clicked on. If both of the pictures are the same they will stay showing on the browser, otherwise you will click on a button that will turn them back to their "plain stage". You will alternate turns with a second player (a friend of yours or family member) and your goal is to find all of the pairs. This game will test your memory and hopefully will make you want to visit my country.

## Tech stack:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* DOM

## MVP Goals

* Have the 10 squares with plain pictures on it
* Button to hide the picture in case you didn't find a pair
* Button to restart the game
* Winning Message
* Alternate between players
* Track of how many pairs each player got

---

## Stretch Goals:

* Make the pictures disappear in 15 seconds in case of a mismatch instead of the button that hides the pictures.
* putting the pictures in different order everytime the game is restarted.
* Making an AI kind of thing that will be the second player.
* Have the 20 squares with plain pictures on it

## Potential roadblocks:

I believe that showing the picture and then hiding it will be hard, keeping track of how many pairs each player found will also be difficult.
